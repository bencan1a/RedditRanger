# Performance Optimization Project Plan

## Current Performance Issues
Based on application logs and code analysis, the following factors contribute to slow initial load times:

1. **NLTK Resource Loading (High Impact)**
   - Resources downloaded on first run
   - No caching mechanism
   - Blocking initialization

2. **Heavy ML Dependencies (High Impact)**
   - Synchronous initialization of sklearn, numpy
   - No lazy loading
   - Large memory footprint on startup

3. **Database Initialization (Medium Impact)**
   - Synchronous database setup
   - No connection pooling
   - Single connection strategy

4. **Multiple Analyzer Services (Medium Impact)**
   - Redundant initializations
   - No service sharing
   - Memory inefficient

5. **Resource Management (Low Impact)**
   - No proper cleanup
   - Memory leaks possible
   - Inefficient resource allocation
